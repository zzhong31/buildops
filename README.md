## To run

Please clone the respository to a directory and then run:

### npm install

From there, you will need to place the aws-exports.js in the /src/ directory. I am not including it in the repository because of the API key.

If you need it, I will provide the file to you.

Once that is done, run:

### npm start

This will host it the app locally.
